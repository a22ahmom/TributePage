                <h2>About Mohammad Daoud Khan</h2>
                <p>Mohammad Daoud Khan was the president of Afghanistan between 1973-1978. 
                    He was a cousin and brother-in-law of King Zahir Shah. 
                    He tried to modernize Afghanistan's economy, education, and army. 
                    Initially, he leaned toward the Soviet Union but later tried to balance relations by reaching out to Western countries. 
                    In April 1978, he was overthrown and killed by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) - an event knwon as the Saur Revolution, which marked the beginning of decades of instability and conflict in Afghanistan.</p>
